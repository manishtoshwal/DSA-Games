Welcome to DSA Game Suite, a collection of entertaining and educational games showcasing various algorithms and data structures!

## Introduction

DSA Game Suite is a project that integrates classic games with fundamental concepts from computer science, particularly algorithms and data structures. Through this suite, players can enjoy popular games while simultaneously learning and exploring concepts like breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, A*, and backtracking.

## Games Included

### 1. Maze Runner

Maze Runner helps players visualize the shortest path through a maze. Utilizing BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and A*, players can visualize different approaches to solving the maze and observe the efficiency of each algorithm in finding the shortest path.

### 2. Sudoku Solver

Sudoku Solver demonstrates the power of backtracking by solving Sudoku puzzles in real-time. Players can generate random Sudoku puzzles to witness the solver in action.

### 3. Snake Game

Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game implemented using 2D arrays and object-oriented programming principles. With its engaging gameplay and smooth GUI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, players can enjoy the game while subtly exploring algorithmic complexity.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of various algorithms and data structures.
- Real-time solving of Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.
- Engaging gameplay experience with Snake Game.
- Educational content blended seamlessly with entertainment.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For game development and GUI.
- Algorithms and Data Structures: Including BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, A*, and backtracking.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implemented in Snake Game for code organization and structure.

## How to Run

To run the games, simply clone this repository and open the HTML files in your web browser. Each game comes with clear instructions on how to play and interact with the algorithms.
