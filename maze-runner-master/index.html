          <h3>BFS Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Breadth-first search (BFS) is a search algorithm for traversing a
            graph or tree. It starts by visiting a node, then adds all of that
            node's neighbors into the queue. Each time it adds a neighbor to the
            queue, it adds a pointer that references the neighboring node's
            parent. Once the queue is empty, which means all nodes have been
            visited, or the goal node is found (for early-exit implementations),
            the pointers are traced from the goal back to the source.

        <div class="DFS info hidden">
          <h3>DFS Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Depth-first search (DFS) is a search algorithm for traversing a
            graph or tree. Rather than considering its shallow neighbors first
            like BFS, it plunges all the way to the bottom of a given branch
            before considering the next neighbor. Once the stack is empty, which
            means all nodes have been visited, or the goal node is found (for
            early-exit implementations), the pointers are traced from the goal
            back to the source.

        <div class="AstarM info hidden">
          <h3>A* Algorithm (Manhattan)</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS and DFS, A* is an informed search
            algorithm. A* is implemented by searching the possible paths to the
            goal and opting for the one that incurs the smallest cost. The cost
            used by A* is the actual distance incremented from the start to the
            current node plus the estimated distance to the goal. In this
            implementation, the Manhattan distance is used for the estimate,
            which is the distance to the goal in the vertical direction plus the
            distance to the goal in the horizontal direction.

        <div class="AstarSL info hidden">
          <h3>A* Algorithm (Straight-Line)</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS and DFS, A* is an informed search
            algorithm. A* is implemented by searching the possible paths to the
            goal and opting for the one that incurs the smallest cost. The cost
            used by A* is the actual distance incremented from the start to the
            current node plus the estimated distance to the goal. In this
            implementation, the straight-line distance to the goal is used as
            the estimate.

        <div class="Dijkstra info hidden">
          <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
          <p>
            Dijkstra's algorithm is similar to BFS, except it incorporates a
            cost heuristic that tracks the cost of different moves and evaluates
            that before deciding which node to visit next. Dijkstra's algorithm
            results in a shortest-path tree to every node in the graph. The
            implementation displayed here incorporates an early exit, where the
            algorithm stops when the goal node is found, and the pointers are
            traced from the goal back to the start.
